# ## **Variables**

# Variables in Python is just pointers. Technically, variables are just areas in your computer's memory where some information is stored.
#
# Python automatically determines which type of value you assign to a variable.
#
# ***
# **х = 38**
#
# **у = **"emailid@python.com"****
#
# `print(x) `
#
# `print(у)`
#
# ***
#
#
# **print (type (x))**
#
# **print (type (у))**
#
#     `<class 'int'>`
#
#     `<class 'str'>`
# ***
# #### Assignment operator
#
# The sign (=) does not mean "equal". It means "assign" in Python, `"equals" is written as " == "`
#
#
# #### Variable names
#
# Earlier we already spoke about variable names. But let's repeat one more time.
#
# * Variable names can contain only letters, number and underscores.
# * Var names can't be started with numbers. ~~5Finger~~
# * Var names can't contain spaces. ~~sales data~~, correct option is sales_data.
# * Var names are case sensitive. Sales and sales are two different variables.
# * You can't use reserved names such as: any, break, try and etc.
# * Hint: to check reserved words you can execute this code:

print(keyword.kwlist)


# ## Program Structure
#
# Before moving forward, let's take a look to the hierarchical structure of the program.
#
# In Python we highlight such parts as: modules, expressions, operators and objects.
#
# * The programs consist of modules.
# * Modules contain expressions.
# * Expressions contain operators.
# * Operators create and process objects.
#
# So, modules are at the top of the program hierarchy, and objects make up it the basis.
#

# ### Objects
#
# We perform operations on Objects.
#
# Examples of simple operations are addition, multiplication of Numbers(Objects) or concatenation of strings (Objects).
#
#
# In Python, all data becomes objects. Objects can either be embedded, which are in Python natively, or we create them ourselves using classes
# Python.
#
# We will also see that in Python everything is an object, whether it's prime numbers or operations performed on them. For a Python script, all these things are objects. Python supports OOP, i.e. object-oriented programming.

#
#
# ***
# #### Classification of Objects
#
# 1. Built-in Objects.
# 2. User-defined objects
#
#     Can also be classified as:
#
#     1. Mutable Objects
#     2. Immutable Objects
#
#
#
# ***
#
#
# | Object type | Example of Objects | Mutable or Immutable |
# |-------------|--------------------|----------------------|
# | Number      | 1234, 3 .1415, 3+4j , OЫll, Decimal (), Fraction ()| Immutable |
# | String | ' nilabh', "Bob's" | Immutable
# | List | [ 1, [ 2, ' three ' ] , 4 . 5] , list ( range (lO) ) | Mutable
# | Dictionary | { ' food' : ' spam' , ' taste ' : ' yum' }, dict (hours:10) | Mutable
# | Tuples | ( 1, ' spam' , 4, 'U' ) , tuple (' spam' ) | Immutable
# | Sets | set ( ' аЬс' ) , { ' а', 'Ь', ' с ' } | Mutable
# | Logical | 0, 1 | Immutable
# | Program components | functions, modules, classes |
#
#
#
#
#
#
#

# #### Object's Identity, values, and types
#
#
# Objects are Python's abstraction for data.
#
# Any data in a Python program is represented either by objects or by relations between objects.
#
# You may think of an Object, as a combination of 3 things:
# * Identity Type
# * Type
# * Value
#
# An object's identity never changes once it has been created. That becomes the object's address in memory.In Python, every Object’s Identity (or Address in memory) is represented by a number. You can see that number by using the id() function.

# In[5]:


a_id_example: int = 5
id(a_id_example)


# The type() function returns an object's type. Like its identity, an object's type is also unchangeable.

# In[6]:


str  # str means String.


# In[7]:


float  # floating point number


# In[8]:


type(["x", "yz", "abc"])  # list containing 3 strings


# In[9]:


type(["x", "y", 1])  # list containing 2 strings and one number


# In[10]:


type({"food": "spam", "taste": "yum"})  # dictionary


# ### Mutable and Immutable Objects
#
# The value of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable; objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable.
#
#
# * instance, numbers, strings, and tuples are immutable
# * dictionaries and lists are mutable
#
#
# Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called `containers`. Examples of containers are **tuples**, **lists**, and **dictionaries**.
#
#

# #### The standard type hierarchy
#
#
# Below is a list of the types that are built into Python.
#
# ##### Built-in constants
#
# 1. None - this type has a single value. This object is accessed through the built-in name `None`.  it is returned
# from functions that don't explicitly return anything. Its truth value is false.
#
# 2. NotImplemented - this type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the built-in name NotImplemented. Its truth value is true.
#
# 3. Ellipsis - this type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the literal ... or the built-in name Ellipsis. Its truth value is true
#
#
#

# #### Numeric types
#
# These are created by numeric literals and returned as results by
# arithmetic operators and arithmetic built-in functions. Numeric
# objects are immutable; once created their value never changes.
#
# 1. `Integers (int)` - these represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available (virtual) memory only.
#
# 2. `Booleans (bool)` - these represent the truth values False and True. The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1.
#
# 3. `Real numbers (float)` - these represent machine-level double precision floating point numbers.
#
# 4. `Complex numbers (complex)` - These represent complex numbers as a pair of machine-level double precision floating point numbers. The same caveats apply as for floating point numbers. The real and imaginary parts of a complex number z can be retrieved through the read-only attributes z.real and z.imag.
#
#

# #### Sequences
#
# These represent finite ordered sets indexed by non-negative
# numbers. The built-in function `len()` returns the number of items of a sequence.  Item i of sequence a is selected by a[i]
#
# Sequences are distinguished according to their mutability.
#

# #### Immutable sequences
#
# Immutable sequences - An object of an immutable sequence type cannot change once it is created.The following types are immutable sequences:

# ##### Strings
#
# A string is a sequence of values that represent Unicode code points.
#
# Python doesn't have a char type; instead, every code point in the string is represented as a string object with length 1.
#
# All the code points in the range U+0000 - U+10FFFF can be represented in a string.
#
# The built-in function `ord()` converts a code point from its string form to an integer in the range 0 - 10FFFF;
#
# `chr()` converts an integer in the range 0 - 10FFFF to the corresponding length 1 string object.

# In[11]:


ord("nilabh"[3])  # this is same as ord('a')


# In[12]:


ord("a")


# In[13]:


chr(97)


# In[14]:


print(chr(96))
print(chr(100))
print(chr(99))
print(chr(1045))
print(chr(100009))


# ##### Tuples
#
# The items of a tuple are arbitrary Python objects. Tuples of two or more items are formed by comma-separated lists of expressions. An empty tuple can be formed by an empty pair of parentheses. `('xyz', 5, 'p') is an example of a tuple.`

# #### Bytes
#
# A bytes object is an immutable array. The items are 8-bit bytes,
# represented by integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. Bytes literals (like b'abc') and the built-in bytes() constructor can be used to create bytes objects. Also, bytes objects can be decoded to strings via the decode() method.
#

# #### Mutable sequences
#
# Mutable sequences can be changed after they are created. There are currently two intrinsic mutable sequence types:
#

# #### Lists
#
# The items of a list are arbitrary Python objects. Lists are formed by placing a comma-separated list of expressions in square brackets.
#
# ['xyz', 5, 'p'] is an example of a list.
#

# ##### Byte Arrays
#
# A bytearray object is a mutable array. They are created by the built-in bytearray() constructor.

# #### Set types
#
# These represent unordered, finite sets of unique, immutable objects.
#
# Common uses for sets are fast membership testing, removing
# duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations
# such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.
#
# ##### Sets
#
# These represent a mutable set. They are created by the built-in set() constructor and can be modified afterward by several methods, such
#
# {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} is an example of a set
#
# ##### Frozen sets
#
# These represent an immutable set. They are created by the built-in
# frozenset() constructor. As a frozenset is immutable and hashable, it can be used again as an element of another set, or as a dictionary key.
#
#
#
#

# #### Mappings
#
# These represent finite sets of objects indexed by arbitrary index sets. The subscript notation a[k] selects the item indexed by k from the mapping a; this can be used in expressions and as the target of assignments or del statements. The built-in function len() returns the number of items in a mapping.
#
#
# ##### Dictionaries
#
# These represent finite sets of objects indexed by nearly arbitrary values. The only types of values not acceptable as
# keys are values containing lists or dictionaries.
#
# Dictionaries are mutable; they can be created by the `{...} `notation
#
# `{"brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964}` is an example of a dictionary in python

# #### Callable types
#
# These are the types to which the function call operation can be
# applied:
#
# ##### Built-in functions
#
# A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. Examples of built-in functions are `len()` and `math.sin()` (math is a standard built-in module)
#
# **To call a function, use the function name followed by a parenthesis.**
#
#
# ##### Instance methods
#
# An instance method object combines a class, a class instance, and any callable object (normally a user-defined function)
#
# ##### Built-in methods
#
# Python method is like a function, except it is attached to an object An example of a built-in method is `alist.append()`, assuming alist is a list object.
#
# ##### Classes
#
# Classes are callable. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
#
#
#
#
#
#
#

# #### Modules
#
# Consider a module to be the same as a code library. To create a
# module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension `.py` Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement.
#
# Modules are a basic organizational unit of Python code and are created by the import system as invoked either by the import statement or by calling functions such as importlib.import_module() and built-in import().
#
#

# ### Operators
#
# Assignment Operators
#
# | Operator | Operation | Equivalent |
# |----------|-----------|------------|
# | =       | a = b| a = b |
# | += | a += b  | a = (a + b) |
# | -= | a -= b | a = (a - b) |
# | *= | a *= b | a = (a * b) |
# | /= | a /= b | a = (a / b) |
# | %= | a %= b | a = (a % b) |
# | //= | a //= b | a = (a // b) |
# | **= | a **= b | a = (a ** b) |
#

# Comparison Operators
#
# | Operator | Operation |
# |----------|-----------|
# | ==       | Equality|
# | != | Inequality |
# | > | Greater than |
# | < | Less than |
# | >= | Greater than or equal to |
# | <= | Less than or equal to |

# Logical Operators
#
# | Operator | Operation |
# |----------|-----------|
# | and       | Logical AND|
# | or | Logical OR |
# | not | Logical NOT |
#
#

# Conditional Operator
#
# | Operator | Operation |  |
# |----------|-----------|------------|
# | Identity Operator | | |
# | is | x is y  | True if x and y are same objects |
# | is not | x is not y | True if x and y are not the same objects |
# | Membership Operator |  |  |
# | in | x in y | True if x is a member of collection y |
# | not in | x not in y | True if x is a not a member of collection y |
#

# In[15]:


4 == 2 * 2


# In[16]:


input_string: str = "string"
if "i" in input_string:
    print("True, Found 'i' in the string")


# #### Indentation
#
# One of the most unmistakable highlights of Python is its utilization of Indentation to mark Blocks of Code.
#
# In Python, it is used for indicating what block of code a
# statement belongs to.
#
# Incorrect indentation will result into `IndentationError`

# #### Python Comments
#
# Comments are very useful while writing a program. It makes the code more readable and tells what's going on inside a program so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out.
#
# In Python, we use the hash (#) symbol to begin the writing of a
# comment.
#
# Python Interpreter ignores the comment

# #### Order of Evaluation in Python
#
# You would remember the order of evaluation in a mathematical
# equation. Similarly, Python has its own `Operator precedence`.
#
#
# The following table summarizes the operator precedence in Python,
# from lowest precedence (least binding) to highest precedence (most binding).
#
#
# | Operator | Description |
# |----------|-----------|
# | lambda   | Lambda expression |
# | if-else | Conditional expression |
# | or | Boolean OR |
# | and | Boolean AND |
# | not x | Boolean NOT |
# | in, not in, is, is not, <, <=, >, >=, !=, ==| Comparisons including membership tests and identity tests |
# | ^ | Bitwise XOR |
# | & | Bitwise AND |
# | <<, >>  | Shifts |
# | +, -  | Addition and subtraction |
# | *, @, /, //, %  |  Multiplication, matrix multiplication, division, floor, division, remainder |
# | +x, -x, ~x | Positive, negative, bitwise NOT |
# | ** | Exponentiation |
# | await x  | Await expression |
# | x[index], x[index:index], x(arguments...), x.attribute | Subscription, slicing, call, attribute reference
# | (expressions...), [expressions...], {key: value...}, {expressions...} | Binding or tuple display, list display, dictionary display, set |display
#
#
#

# #### Changing the Order of Evaluation
#
# To make the expressions more readable, we shall use parentheses. For example, 2 + (3 * 4) is definitely easier to understand than 2 + 3 * 4 which requires knowledge of the operator precedence.

# #### Dynamic Typing
#
# In Python, though the value that a variable point to has a type, the variable itself has no strict type in its definition. You can reuse the same variable to point to an object of a different type.

# In[17]:


six_number: int = 6
six_number


# In[18]:


six_string: str = "six"
six_string


# #### Summary
#
# In this chapter, we learned the Semantics of Python as a language, and also brushed some of the Syntax or python we saw in the previous chapter. We learned about the hierarchy and
# structure of Python code. How everything is an Object in Python, and what are the features of objects. We have seen how to use operators, operands, and expressions - these are the basic building blocks of any program.

# #### Answer the following
#
# 1. **What is a Variable in Python? How is it different from an object?**
#
#     Variables in python are just pointers. They do not have any value in themselves, but they point to the object they are assigned to.
#
#     An object is a data structure in Python, representing any value (like numbers, strings, lists, etc.). Everything in Python is an object, including functions and classes.
#
#
# 2. **What is the convention to name a variable in Python?**
#
#     * Variable names can contain only letters, number and underscores.
#     * Var names can't be started with numbers. ~~5Finger~~
#     * Var names can't contain spaces. ~~sales data~~, correct option is sales_data.
#     * Var names are case sensitive. Sales and sales are two different variables.
#     * You can't use reserved names such as: any, break, try and etc.
#
# 3. **What are the advantages of having built-in objects in Python?**
#
#     Built-in objects making easier to perform common tasks without requiring custom implementations
#
# 4. **What does immutable means? What objects are immutable in Python?**
#
#     Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable.
#
#     Objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable
#
# 5. **What do you mean by an object's Identity? How is it different from its type?**
#
#     Object's identity refers to its unique location in memory.
#
#     Type defines what kind of object it is and what behavior (methods, operations) it supports.
#
# 6. **What do chr() and ord() functions do? How are they related to one another?**
#
#     The chr() and ord() functions in Python are used for converting between characters and their corresponding Unicode (or ASCII) integer values.
#
#     chr() - `converts an integer `(Unicode code point) into the corresponding character.
#
#     ord() - `converts a character` into its corresponding Unicode (or ASCII) integer value.
#
# 7. **What is an operator? How many types of Operators are there in Python? Name them all.**
#
#     An operator in Python is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands (values or variables)
#
#     Arithmetic Operators
#     Comparison Operators
#     Conditional Operator
#     Logical Operators
#     Identity Operators
#     Bitwise Operators
#     Membership Operators
#
# 8. **/ And //, both are division operators. What is the difference between them?**
#
#     / - floating-point division, always returns a floating-point number
#     // - floor division, Divide x by y and round the answer down to the nearest integer value. If one of the values is a float you'll get back a float
#
# 9. **What value do the logical operators return?**
#
#     These operators are used to perform logical operations, and they return either a boolean value (True or False)
#
# 10. **What is the importance of Indentation in Python Programming language?**
#
#     Indentation is used to define the structure of the program by grouping statements into blocks.
#
# 11. **How do you write comments in Python? Why are they important**
#
#     Comments are used to add explanatory notes or descriptions within the code
#
#     They help programmers and others reading the code understand its purpose and functionality
#
#     You can write a single-line comment by placing a hash symbol # before the comment text.
#
# 12. **How to change the order of evaluation in Python**
#
#     The most common way to change the order of evaluation in Python is to use parentheses ()
#
# 13. **What is the difference between a logical line and a physical line?**
#
#     A physical line refers to a single line of text in the source code file.
#
#     A logical line is a unit of code that Python interprets as a single statement or command, regardless of how many physical lines it spans.
#
#     **Example with multiple physical lines forming a single logical line**
#
#
#     * result = (1 + 2 +
#
#             3 + 4)  This is one logical line split across multiple physical lines
#
#
#
#

# #### True or False
#
# 1. Variables in Python acquire the value assigned to them.
#
#     True
#
# 2. In Python, before creating a variable, you need to define its  type first.
#
#     False
#
# 3. x = 38 and x == 38 are not the same thing in Python.
#
#     True
#
# 4. We perform operations on objects in Python.
#
#     True
#
# 5. Python Keywords can be used as the name of a variable.
#
#     False
#
# 6. Custom data structures are more efficient than the built-in objects.
#
#     False
#
# 7. An object's identity never changes once it’s created.
#
#     True
#
# 8. Comments in programs make the program more readable and easy to
# understand.
#
#     True
#
# 9. Indentation is just a way to make programs better looking and more readable.
#
#     False
#
# 10. The % (Modulo) operator is used to find out if the division of two numbers yields any remainder.
#
#     True
